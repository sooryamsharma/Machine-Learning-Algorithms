### Task
    Implement a simulation, where you estimate the probability of a binary event using a frequentist approach. 
    The data will be generated by your code using a specific probability distribution, but then your code will ESTIMATE that distribution based on the data that was generated.
    Naturally, the estimated distribution will probably not be identical to the true distribution that was used.
    First, your code a random string S whose length is 3100 characters: S = c1, c2, c3100. 
    The length of 3100 is based on the "snow in January" example covered in class, it corresponds to 100 years of weather records of January days). 
    To generate the string S, follow these guidelines:

    Each character ci is either character 'a' or character 'b'.
    Each characer c should be chosen randomly, so that the prior p(c = 'a') = 0.1. To do this, your code should:
    Generate a random number, drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
    If that random number is less than or equal to 0.1, then the character should be set to 'a'. If the random number is greater than 0.1, the character should be set to 'b'.
    You should make sure that the choice of any character is independent from the choice of any other character. In other words: if i != j, then P(ci = 'a' | cj = 'a') = P(ci = 'a').
    After you generate the string S, you should estimate (using the frequentist approach) the probability p(c = 'a'), based on the characters of S. At the end, your code should print out the estimated probability. 
    The program output should follow EXACTLY this format:
    p(c = 'a') = %.4f
